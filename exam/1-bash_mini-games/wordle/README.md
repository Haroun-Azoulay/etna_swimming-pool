### ‚≠ê Objectifs

Wordle is a daily word guessing game created by the New York Times.

The rules are simple:

The player has six attempts to find a five-letter word, by making guesses and getting clues.
Each guess must be a valid five-letter word.
After each try, the color of the squares will change to show how close your guess is to the target word.

### ‚ÑπÔ∏è Ressources

For this project, a lib.sh file is provided, containing two functions:
getRandomWord and getInput.

The words generated by getRandomWord are English words.

2. You must guess this number by entering a digit at each attempt.
3. At each attempt, the computer tells you whether your guess is "too high" or "too low".

your program will need to:

1. Generate a random target number between 1 and 100.
2. Allow the user to enter guesses.
3. Indicate whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct.

Your program will need to:

2. Receive input from the user
3. Check if the word is correct, and reveal clues if not

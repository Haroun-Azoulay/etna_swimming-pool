# <p align="center">Open the Gate</p>
  


### ‚≠ê Scenario

Right after leaving the bed, you stumble on a little chest. "A gift from the Princess" Navi says.

Inside, you find an excessively huge manual, dozens of jewels, and a huge purple stone, round and light-weighted: the Gate of Hyrule, as Navi calls it.

As you pick up the stone, another small hand-written note falls at your feet.

"Dear Hero,

Inside this single box, you will find everything I could prepare for you before the Dark Lord took me prisonner.

Please forgive me as I could not find the time to activate the Gate.

May you need to use it, you will have to find a way to restore its power beforehand.

However, I know you won't have any trouble resolving this first puzzle.

I pray for your success,

Zelda"

Navi quietly flies around the content of the chest, probably staring at it with unknown eyes.


### üìî Instructions

The Gate of Hyrule looks pale and inanimate, sign that it is not active. It's currently missing a part... To turn it on, you'll need to download it.

Luckily, Princess Zelda gave us these little jewels: they are bash commands.

To complete each stages of the quest, you will need to learn how to use them. For now, you won't use many of them, but eventually, as you move forward in your adventure, you'll need to manipulate more of them.

You don't have to worry as I will tell you exactly which commands you'll need for each exercice.

Also, Princess Zelda has left us this massive and incredible book called: "the manual".

To open it, you just need to type on your terminal man followed by the name of the command you want to learn about.

For instance, to restore the Gate of Hyrule, you will need the right packages. Try the magic command: php gate-of-hyrule.php.

If you stumble upon an error, it probably means that, as the Princess said, you are lacking the good packages.

To install them, use the command apt-get. Try using the manual to learn about it, with the command man apt-get.

Once you managed to start the gate with php gate-of-hyrule.php check 1, write down the first token in your token.txt file.


### ‚ö†Ô∏è Jewels you will need

- apt-get
- man
- sudo


### üì¨ How to submit your steps

If you are not familiar yet with the Git source control system, tutorial videos are available on your intranet, here at this link.

I strongly recommend watching them from 1 to 4 as they will teach you the basics you need to submit your work.

It is OK if you don't understand everything right away, as you will slowly get the hang of it by advancing in the quest and practicing.

For now, you will only need to use git clone, git add, git commit and git push.

Once you have cloned your repository, inside of it:

- For each step, you have to create a folder, that you will name after it. e.g. for step one, you have to create a folder named ¬´ step1 ¬ª. In this folder you have to create ¬´ token.txt ¬ª and fill it using the passphrase you have found for the step.
- The file should only contain the passphrase or else the autograder will not be able to correct your step.
- Once you have created your token file and folder, you have to hand them in for correction, by adding, committing and pushing them using Git
